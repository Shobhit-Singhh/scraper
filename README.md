# Web Scraper and NLP Text Analysis Project

Hello, LinkedIn community! üëã I'm excited to share a project that I've been working on, combining web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and text classification. Let's dive into the details!

## Project Overview:

I have developed a web scraper along with a program that iterates through an Excel file containing links to web pages. The program extracts text from each page and performs a comprehensive analysis using various NLP techniques.


## New Update: 
Utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), textprocessing (regularexpression, stemming&cleaning), and vectorization methods (BOW, N-gram, tf-idf) to analyze sentiment & train a Customer review classification model on a Kaggle dataset, please check code file(Sentiment_Analysis-2.ipynb)


## Key Features:

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Positive Score
  - Negative Score
  - Polarity Score
  - Subjectivity Score

- **Text Metrics:**
  - Avg Sentence Length
  - Percentage of Complex Words
  - FOG Index
  - Avg Number of Words per Sentence
  - Complex Word Count
  - Word Count
  - Syllables per Word
  - Avg Word Length

- **Personal Pronouns:**
  - Count of personal pronouns (e.g., I, me, you)

## Workflow:

1. The program reads a list of web page links from an Excel file.
2. Web scraping extracts text content from each page.
3. NLP analysis calculates the specified metrics, providing valuable insights into the content.

## Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification:

The project goes beyond basic analysis by incorporating sentiment analysis and text classification. These steps involve identifying and categorizing the sentiment expressed in the text, as well as classifying the content based on predefined categories.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Web Scraping Libraries
- Natural Language Processing Libraries
- Excel for Data Input

## Achievements:

- Successful extraction of relevant information from diverse web pages.
- Implementation of an efficient NLP pipeline for detailed text analysis.
- Accurate sentiment analysis and text classification results.

## Next Steps:

I am continuously refining and expanding the project to enhance its capabilities. If you're interested in NLP, web scraping, or text analysis, I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations or share insights.
